Good day, 

I love R programming for solving problems.  I want to spend my future conducting time-series analysis and experimenting with machine learning applications.  I have been using stock charts for most of my professional career and enjoy making those and other sorts of data visualizations. 

I'm focused in roles that expand that my data science skills nowadays but have worked in financial services for the last 10 years in a variety of roles:

 - Customer service roles speaking to financial advisors and clients about investment products.
 - Compliance and the auditing of financial advisors and their business operations.  
 - Supervision of financial advisor trades and transactions within client accounts.
 - Quantitative analysis of investment transactions and trends.  
 
I graduated from the [Master of Science in Business Data Analytics](https://business.wvu.edu/academics/management-information-systems/business-data-analytics) program @ West Virginia University in August of 2021.   I loved the program, and you should check it out if that is something that interests you.  

 - It was rated # 6 in Fortune's [Best Online Master's in Business Analytics Programs in 2022](https://fortune.com/education/business-analytics/masters/rankings/best-online-masters-in-business-analytics/)
